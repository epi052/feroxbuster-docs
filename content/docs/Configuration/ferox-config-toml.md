  Configure feroxbuster settings using a .toml file

## ferox-config.toml

After built-in default values are set, any values defined in a `ferox-config.toml` config file will override the
built-in defaults.

`feroxbuster` searches for `ferox-config.toml` in the following locations (in the order shown):

- `/etc/feroxbuster/` (global)
- `CONFIG_DIR/feroxbuster/` (per-user)
- The same directory as the `feroxbuster` executable (per-user)
- The user's current working directory (per-target)

> `CONFIG_DIR` is defined as the following:
> - Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `$HOME/.config` i.e. `/home/bob/.config`
> - MacOs: `$HOME/Library/Application Support` i.e. `/Users/bob/Library/Application Support`
> - Windows: `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}` i.e. `C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Roaming`

If more than one valid configuration file is found, each one overwrites the values found previously.

If no configuration file is found, nothing happens at this stage.

As an example, let's say that we prefer to use a different wordlist as our default when scanning; we can set
the `wordlist` value in the config file to override the baked-in default.

Notes of interest:

- it's ok to only specify values you want to change without specifying anything else
- variable names in `ferox-config.toml` must match their command-line counterpart

```toml
# ferox-config.toml

wordlist = "/wordlists/jhaddix/all.txt"
```

A pre-made configuration file with examples of all available settings can be found in `ferox-config.toml.example`.

```toml
# Example configuration for feroxbuster
#
# If you wish to provide persistent settings to feroxbuster, rename this file to ferox-config.toml and make sure
# it resides in the same directory as the feroxbuster binary.
#
# After that, uncomment any line to override the default value provided by the binary itself.
#
# Any setting used here can be overridden by the corresponding command line option/argument
