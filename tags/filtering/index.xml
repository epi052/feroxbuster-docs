&lt;p>Version 1.3.0 included an overhaul to the filtering system which will allow for a wide array of filters to be added with
minimal effort. The first such filter is a &lt;strong>Status Code&lt;/strong> Filter. As responses come back from the scanned server, each one
is checked against a list of known filters and either displayed or not according to which filters are set.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --filter-status 301
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h2 id="270-update">2.7.0 Update&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>--filter-status&lt;/code> behavior was updated in 2.7.0. &lt;code>--filter-status&lt;/code> is now a deny-list for the values provided, while
every other status code will be allowed through.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Filter by Word/Line Count</title><link>/feroxbuster-docs/docs/examples/filter-word-line/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/feroxbuster-docs/docs/examples/filter-word-line/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="filter-response-by-word-count--line-count">Filter Response by Word Count &amp;amp; Line Count&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In addition to filtering on the size of a response, version 1.6.0 added the ability to filter out responses based on the
number of lines and/or words contained within the response body. This change drove a change to the information displayed
to the user as well. This section will detail the new information and how to make use of it with the new filters
provided.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Filter by Regex</title><link>/feroxbuster-docs/docs/examples/filter-regex/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/feroxbuster-docs/docs/examples/filter-regex/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="filter-response-using-a-regular-expression">Filter Response Using a Regular Expression&lt;/h2>

 Using regular expressions to filter large responses or many regular expressions may negatively impact
performance.

&lt;/div>

&lt;p>Version 1.3.0 included an overhaul to the filtering system which allows for a wide array of filters to be added with
minimal effort. The latest addition is a Regular Expression Filter. As responses come back from the scanned server,
the &lt;strong>body&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>headers&lt;/strong> of the response are checked against the filter&amp;rsquo;s regular expression. If the expression is found in the body,
then that response is filtered out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Filter by Page Similarity</title><link>/feroxbuster-docs/docs/examples/filter-similar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/feroxbuster-docs/docs/examples/filter-similar/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="filter-response-by-similarity-to-a-given-page">Filter Response by Similarity to A Given Page&lt;/h2>


&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
&lt;h4 class="alert-heading">Heads up&lt;/h4>

 &lt;ul>
&lt;li>Using a bunch of &lt;code>--filter-similar-to&lt;/code> values &lt;strong>may&lt;/strong> negatively impact performance&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>


&lt;/div>

&lt;p>Version 1.11.0 adds the ability to specify an example page for filtering pages that are similar to the given example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Version 2.8.0 updated the underlying algorithm from SSDeep to Simhash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, consider a site that attempts to redirect new users to a &lt;code>/register&lt;/code> endpoint. The &lt;code>/register&lt;/code> page has a
CSRF token that alters the page&amp;rsquo;s response slightly with each new request (sometimes affecting overall length). This
means that a simple line/word/char filter won&amp;rsquo;t be able to filter all responses. In order to filter those redirects out,
one could use a command like this:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
