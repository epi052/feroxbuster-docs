## Replay Responses to a Proxy based on Status Code

<Aside type="caution" title="Heads up">
this means that for every response that matches your replay criteria, you'll end up sending the request that
generated that response a second time. Depending on the target and your engagement terms (if any), it may not make sense
from a traffic generated perspective.
</Aside>

The `--replay-proxy` and `--replay-codes` options were added as a way to only send a select few responses to a proxy.
This is in stark contrast to `--proxy` which proxies EVERY request.

Imagine you only care about proxying responses that have either the status code `200` or `302` (or you just don't want
to clutter up your Burp history). These two options will allow you to fine-tune what gets proxied and what doesn't.

```
./feroxbuster -u http://127.1 --replay-proxy http://localhost:8080 --replay-codes 200 302 --insecure
```
