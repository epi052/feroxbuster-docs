<Aside type="note" title="Changing the Scan Limit">
Interactively changing the scan limit follows the rules below:

- Setting the limit to a number **higher** than the current number of directory scans allows new/waiting scans to immediately start
- Setting the limit to a number **lower** than the current number of directory scans does not affect scans already running. It will take effect as soon as the number of active scans drops to/below the new limit.

Consider the following example:

A scan was started with a limit of four (`--scan-limit 4`).
The scan progresses and four directories are actively being scanned and another four are waiting to start.

```

```

There are too many requests flying at once, so you decide to decrease the speed of the overall scan by decreasing the limit from four to two.

```
set-limit 2
```

At this point, there is no immediately discernable difference. The four active scans will continue to run until they complete. Once there are only two active scans left will the new limit take effect.

After the first scan completes, the number of active scans becomes 3 with a limit of 2.

## Scan Management Menu™

Version 1.12.0 expanded the pause/resume functionality introduced in [v1.4.0](/feroxbuster-docs/examples/pause-scan/) by adding an interactive menu from which currently running recursive scans can be cancelled, without affecting the overall scan. Scans can still be paused indefinitely by pressing `ENTER`.

Version 2.4.1 expanded functionality even further with the ability to add a brand-new scan. Now that cancelling is no longer the only action available to users, the name has been updated to the **Scan Management Menu**™. 

Version 2.6.2 brought yet another capability: users can now add new filters to their current scan. Adding a new filter works the same as though you had specified `--filter-*` on the command-line. 

Version 2.12.0 continued to improve on the **Scan Management Menu**™ menu by adding the ability to adjust the maximum number of concurrent directory scans that can progress at any given time. Additionally, a status line showing the current limit and how much of that limit is actively in use (i.e. number of active directory scans). Setting a new scan limit works the same as though you had specified `-L|--scan-limit` on the command line.

## Example 

Below is an example of the Scan ~~Cancel~~ Management Menu™.

![cancel-menu](/feroxbuster-docs/images/examples/cancel-menu.png)

## Usage

Using the menu is pretty simple: from a running scan, press `ENTER` to view the menu

### Cancel a Scan

- Choose a scan to cancel by entering `cancel` or `c` followed by its scan index (`1`)
  - more than one scan can be selected by using a comma-separated list of indexes and/or ranges (`1-4,8,9-13` ... etc)
- Confirm selections, after which all non-cancelled scans will resume
  - To skip confirmation, simply add a `-f` somewhere in your input (`3-5 -f`)

### Add a New Url for Scanning

- Enter `add` or `a` followed by the new url you'd liked you add to the current scan queue 

### Add a New Response Filter 

- Enter `new-filter` or `n`, then the type of filter you'd like to add, and the value to pass to the filter itself.

Valid filter types:
- `status`
- `lines`
- `size`
- `words`
- `regex`
- `similarity`

Examples: 

- `n status 301` - equivalent to command-line option `--filter-status 301`
- `new-filter lines 1` - equivalent to command-line option `--filter-lines 1`
- `new-filter words 7` - equivalent to command-line option `--filter-words 7`
- `n regex token:[0-9a-zA-Z]+` - equivalent to command-line option `--filter-regex 'token:[0-9a-zA-Z]+'`
- `n similarity https://target.url/page/with/csrf-token` - equivalent to command-line option `--filter-similar-to https://target.url/page/with/csrf-token`
- `new-filter size 1337` - equivalent to command-line option `--filter-size 1337`

### Set a Scan Limit (-L)

- Enter `set-limit` or `s` followed by the new limit of concurrent directories you'd like to scan.

## Demonstration

Here is a short demonstration of the menu's `cancel` and `add` capabilities. They're shown on an older version of the menu, but the functionality has not changed for these two commands.

Another short demo, this time showcasing the menu's `new-filter` and `rm-filter` commands.
